# DIFFERENCE OF CONVOLUTION FOR DEEP COMPRESSIVE SENSING 
## Abstract
Deep learning-based compressive sensing (DCS) has improved the compressive sensing (CS) with fast and high reconstruction quality. Researchers have further extended it to multi-scale DCS which improves reconstruction quality based on Wavelet decomposition. In this work, we mimic the Difference of Gaussian via convolution and propose a scheme named as Difference of convolution-based multi-scale DCS (DoC-DCS). Unlike the multi-scale DCS based on a well-designed filter in wavelet domain, the proposed DoC-DCS learns decomposition, thereby, outperforms other state-of-the-art compressive sensing methods.
